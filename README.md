# Functional Programming Examples
These are some :smirk: fp examples I've been studying.  
More will come.



## Order in chaos
:books: This is the order I've used to learn and understand the FP approach:
1. Start by understanding Higher Order Functions (`HOF.js`)
2. Continue with `curry.js`
3. Check out the `curry-example.js` to have a "real life" example of currying
4. Understand how to build a pipe fn with curry - `pipe.js`
5. Does arg order matter? - Test out `argument-order.js` 
6. Finally `mind-blowing-pipe-example.js`
